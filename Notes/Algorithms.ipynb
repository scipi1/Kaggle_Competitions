    "### Decrease and Conquer\n",
    "It is a computational problem-solving tecniques, which takes the original problem, reduces to a smaller problem, which is easier to solve (N.B. Different from \"Divide and conquer\", which devides the problem into multiple smaller problems). Some examples are:\n",
    "- Binary Search\n",
    "- Euclidian Algorithm\n",
    "- Depth-first search (DFS)\n",
    "- Breadth-first search (BFS)\n",
    "- Insertion sort and selection sort\n",
    "How is the problem decreased?\n",
    "- By a constant, usually 1 (DFS, BFS)\n",
    "- By a factor, usually 2 (Binary Search, Fake-coin detection problem, Russian peasant multiplication)\n",
    "- Variable size decrease (Euclidian Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary search\n",
    "It is a Decrease and Conquer algorithm because the size of the problem is reduced by a factor of 2. We have to find a target value in a list\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data must be sorted\n",
    "2) We will have a LOW pointer at index 0 and a HIGH pointer at index the last index N-1\n",
    "3) We calculate the middle pointer MID = LOW + HIGH // 2\n",
    "   - If the target < value at MID, we will procede only with the first half and we set HIGH = MID and leave LOW\n",
    "   - If the target > value at MID, we will procede only with the second half and we set LOW = MID and leave HIGH\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Repeat untill the target value is found\n",
    "\n",
    "The Time Complexity of Binary Search is $O(\\log{n})$ which is very efficient! But...data must be sorted! Most sorting algoritms have Time Complexity of $O(n\\log{n})$ which is worse than $O(n)$. Therefore, Binary Search makes sense only if the data will be searched multiple times."
